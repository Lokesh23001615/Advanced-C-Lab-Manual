# EXP NO:13 C PROGRAM TO DISPLAY QUEUE ELEMENTS USING ARRAY.
## Aim:
To write a C program to display queue elements using array

## Algorithm:
   * Step 1.	Declare global variables for the queue, rear, front, and iteration
   * Step 2.	Define the display function to print the elements of the queue.
   * Step 3.	Initialize the queue, rear, and front as needed.
   * Step 4.	Call the display function and perform other queue operations as needed.
 
## Program:
```
```
## Output:

//paste your output here


## Result:
Thus, the program to display queue elements using array is verified successfully.


 
# EXP NO:14 C PROGRAM TO INSERT ELEMENTS IN QUEUE USING ARRAY.
## Aim:
To write a C program to insert elements in queue using array.

## Algorithm:
   * Step 1.	Declare global variables for the size, rear, front, and the queue itself.
   * Step 2.	Define the enqueue function to add a float to the queue.
   * Step 3.	Initialize the rear, front, and size of the queue as needed.
   * Step 4.	Call the enqueue function as needed.

## Program:
```
//type your code here
```
## Output:

//paste your output here

## Result:
Thus, the program to insert elements in queue using array is verified successfully.



 
# EXP NO:15 C FUNCTION TO DELETE ELEMENTS IN QUEUE USING ARRAY

## Aim:

To create a function in C that deletes an element from a queue implemented using an array.

## Algorithm:
   * Step 1.	Check if the Queue is Empty
    	- If the front pointer is -1, it means the queue is empty, and there are no elements to delete. Print a message indicating that the queue is empty.
   * Step 2.	Delete the Front Element
     - If the queue is not empty, the element at the front index is deleted.
     - Increment the front pointer by 1 to remove the element and point to the next element in the queue.
   * Step 3.	Check if the Queue Becomes Empty After Deletion:
     - After deletion, check if the front pointer has passed the rear pointer (front > rear). If this is true, reset both front and rear to -1, indicating that the queue is now empty.
   * Step 4.	End the Function.



## Program:
```
```

## Output:

//paste your output here


## Result:
Thus, the function that deletes an element from a queue implemented using an array is verified successfully.
